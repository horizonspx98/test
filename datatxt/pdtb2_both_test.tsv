Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high, and expensive, circulations is the way to draw advertisers.	In recent years, Reader's Digest, New York Times Co. 's McCall's, and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide, have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation.	1

The privilege, however, has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only.	The Supreme Court and some states have recognized that "the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause.	1
that "the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause." Baxter v..Palmingiano, 425 U.S. 308 (1976).	in a civil case, a defendant may be called as a witness, he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth, and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter.	2
Thus, in a civil case, a defendant may be called as a witness, he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth.	his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter.	1
Thus, in a civil case, a defendant may be called as a witness, he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth, and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter.

He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution.	Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one's testimony harms him in the civil matter, but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.	1

Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter.	but the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.	2
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one's testimony harms him in the civil matter, but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.	Absent the risk of such prosecution, a court may order the defendant to testify.	2
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution.	when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding, particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel, one must conclude that he held a good-faith, justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.	2

In many ways, the backdrop to Friday's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987's 508-point crash.	Then, as now, the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold..The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy, although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve..And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous.	1
